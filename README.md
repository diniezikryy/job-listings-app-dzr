## My process

Learnt React and TailwindCSS on youtube and decided to attempt this challenge to solidify my React and TailwindCSS. This React project presented me with the challenge of writing the code for the components as well as being able to filter the data. I also wanted to be able to render the data for the app using a simple JSON backend server and ExpressJS. My first step was to write some basic data in a JSON file so that I can design the app first with JSON data using TailwindCSS. Then, I wanted to write a simple API using ExpressJS and allow the app to retrieve this data from the API using Axios. The last step was just to connect the simple API to the frontend.

### Built with

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Continued development

Despite stopping after achieving my objectives, my future plans for this web app is to be able to add their own job listings.
